## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
-   **Node.js** (v18.x or later recommended)
-   **npm** or **yarn**

### Local Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
    *(**Action Required:** Replace the URL with your repository's clone URL.)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    or if you use yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    This project connects to the Google Sheets API to fetch data. You will need to create a local environment file with the necessary credentials.

    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if you have one) or use the template below:

    ```env
    # .env file
    # --- Google Sheets API Credentials ---
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
    REACT_APP_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
    ```
    *(**Important Action Required:** Replace the variable names and values with the actual credentials from your Google Cloud Platform project. You can get these credentials by setting up a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).)*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    The application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
    ```sh
    npm start
